## Writing cypress tests
Cypress tests for frontend can be made in /src/frontend/cypress/e2e

Files are named 'Yourtestname.cy.js'. Testing process starts with 'describe('sonething', function(){all tests})'. It is recommended to use
```
beforeEach(function(){
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')
  })
```
at the beginning to make sure the browser opens at every test. Tests can be written inside ``` it()``` functions. Basic types of testing functions include ```cy.contains()```, ```.click()``` and ```cy.get()```

### ```cy.contains()```
contains is used to find text from page. Text can be inside a button or just on its own.

### ```.click()```
click is used to click buttons. Usually it is used after contains: ```cy.contains('').click() to click button that contains certain type of text.

### ```cy.get()```
get is used to find fields. If you want to find certain field and write in it, you can use ```cy.get(#fieldname).type('')```.
